The company has extensively invested in both traditional and digital marketing, including Google search engines and maintaining an active social media presence. Despite its successes, Bellabeat recognizes the potential for further growth. Therefore, an in-depth analysis of consumer data from a different brand will be conducted to inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy and potentially enhance its existing products and features.\n\n## Products\n* **Bellabeat App** - Provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits, allowing users to understand their habits better and make healthier decisions.\n* **Bellabeat Membership** - Offers users 24/7 access to personalized guidance on nutrition, activity, sleep, health and beauty, and mindfulness tailored to their lifestyle and goals.\n* **Leaf** - A wearable wellness tracker available as a bracelet, necklace, or clip. It can track activity, sleep, and stress levels while also sending reminders to stay active.\n* **Spring** - A smart water bottle tracking daily water intake.\n* **Time** - A luxury wellness watch equipped with smart technology to monitor user’s activity, sleep, and stress levels, providing insight into users’ daily lifestyle and progress while sending reminders to stay active. Its elegant design makes the watch suitable for any occasion.\n* **Ivy** - A health tracker in the form of an elegant bracelet, monitoring not only activity, sleep, and stress but also heart rate, respiratory rate, cardiac coherence, and physical and mental activity.\n\n## Target Audience\n### Key Demographics\n* **Age:** [19 - 40](https://www.wework.com/ideas/community-stories/member-spotlight/bellabeat-chic-fitness-tracker-looks-like-jewelry-keeps-women-healthy); women in various life stages, from puberty to menopause\n* **Gender:** Female\n* **Location:** Primarily the USA, with additional markets in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East\n* **Socio-economic Status:** Middle and upper-class working professionals\n\n### Key Psychographics\n* They have a **holistic view of health** by caring for the whole person - the physical, mental, spiritual, and social well-being.\n* They are **health-conscious**, prioritising healthy dietary choices.\n* They **tend to invest considerable money on health care and wellness**.\n### Challenges and Needs\n* **Limited time for daily workouts** due to typical 5-day workweeks.\n* Desire for fitness trackers that are **functional, sleek, and stylish, suitable for any occasion**. \n\n<a id=\"section-one\"></a>\n# Section 1: Ask\nIn this section, the problem to be solved will be defined.\n\n<a id=\"business-task\"></a>\n## 1.1 Business Task\nBellabeat aims to identify potential growth opportunities by analyzing smart device usage data to understand how consumers use **non-Bellabeat** smart devices. Insights gained will guide Bellabeat's marketing strategy and inspire new ideas for their existing products and services.\n\nThis case study will focus on improving one of Bellabeat's products - **Ivy, the wellness and health tracker**. \n\n### Questions to Consider\n1. What are the current trends in smart device usage?\n2. How do these trends relate to Bellabeat's target customers?\n3. How can these trends influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?\n\n<a id=\"key-stakeholders\"></a>\n## 1.2 Key Stakeholders\n* **Urška Sršen** - Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat\n* **Sando Mur** - Co-founder and member of Bellabeat's executive team\n* **Bellabeat Marketing Analytics Team**\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<a id=\"section-two\"></a>\n# Section 2: Prepare\nIn this section, useful and relevant data for solving the business task will be identified.\n\n<a id=\"data-source-and-data-organisation\"></a>\n## 2.1 Data Source and Data Organisation\nFor this case study, the [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) will be used. The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle. The dataset was collected through a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk **between March 12, 2016, and May 12, 2016**. It contains personal tracker data from **30 Fitbit users**, who consented to submit minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. This includes information on daily activity, steps, and heart rate, revealing patterns in users' habits. The dataset is organized into 18 CSV files in both long and wide formats.\n\n<a id=\"data-licensing-and-privacy\"></a>\n## 2.2 Data Licensing and Privacy\nThe dataset is published by Möbius under the CC0: Public Domain Creative License, allowing free use without requiring permission from the copyright owner. Therefore, no licensing for the dataset is needed for this analysis.\n\nParticipants provided consent for the submission of personal tracker data, and their identities were anonymized using ID numbers instead of real names to ensure participant confidentiality.\n\n<a id=\"ROCCC-analysis\"></a>\n## 2.3 ROCCC Analysis\nTo evaluate if the data source is credible and trustworthy, the ROCCC analysis will be employed.\n\n**R**eliable: **Low**\n* The dataset includes only 30 participants, which may not adequately represent Fitbit's user base, which is more than [31 million in 2020](https://www.statista.com/statistics/472600/fitbit-active-users/). While the sample size is small, according to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the sample of 30 is the smallest size that is still considered valid. However, a larger sample size would still be recommended to increase the confidence level of the research.\n* The survey was conducted over two months, from 03/12/2016 to 05/12/2016, but the data only shows one month of activity from 04/12/2016 to 05/12/2016. While some people might have daily fitness routines, many people might adjust their fitness routine throughout the seasons. One month of data might not reflect that adjustment. A longer timeframe, spanning a full year, would offer more comprehensive insights.\n* Amazon Mechanical Turk is known to [resemble the US population](https://researchmethodscommunity.sagepub.com/blog/who-can-i-sample-on-amazon-mechanical-turk) fairly well, relevant to this study as Bellabeat's customers are predominantly Americans.\n\n**O**riginal: **Low**\n* Third-party data from Amazon Mechanical Turk was used. While this company is commonly used for behavioral research, direct data from Fitbit would bolster reliability.\n\n**C**omprehensive: **Medium**\n* The dataset includes information about activity, sleep, steps, and heart rate, relevant to understanding smart device usage trends.\n* Bellabeat's target market is women. Therefore, data related specifically to women's health and activity would be beneficial to find trends that could be applied to Bellabeat's customers.\n* The dataset focuses solely on Fitbit data. However, there are many other fitness smart device companies with different functionalities and services, which could provide additional insights.\n\n**C**urrent: **Low**\n* The study was conducted in 2016, which was 7 years ago. Since then, [fitness trends have evolved significantly](https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/fulltext/2022/01000/worldwide_survey_of_fitness_trends_for_2022.6.aspx), especially after Covid-19. For instance, outdoor activities surged in popularity, and home exercise gyms became more prevalent, trends that were not prominent in 2016.\n* Wearable fitness technology was the no.1 trend in both 2016 and 2022. However, during that period, health and fitness technology have developed immensely, with many new services and functions being provided.\n* These changes may decrease the usefulness and relevance of the data, potentially rendering it insufficient for current analysis.\n\n**C**ited: **High**\n* The data is cited with sources being documented.\n* Data was collected by a third-party company, Amazon Mechanical Turk, made available through Möbius.\n* The dataset was last updated 3 years ago.\n\n<a id=\"limitations\"></a>\n## 2.4 Limitations\n* **No demographic characteristics** about the participants were collected, such as their gender, age, location, and lifestyle. Without this information, it's challenging to determine if the dataset accurately represents Bellabeat's target audience.\n* It is also **unknown how the data was collected**.

However, \"minute_sleep\" uses both UpperCamelCase and lowercase formats. → All variable names will be standardised to follow the snake_case naming convention using the `clean_names()` function. This will make all the variable names consistent and easier to read.\n2. **Different names for variables with the same meaning**: Although most columns with variables of the same meaning share consistent titles across all dataframes (e.g., \"Id\"), the date columns exhibit variations such as \"ActivityDate,\" \"ActivityDay,\" and \"Time.\" → These variables will be renamed to follow the same title \"activity_date.\" This will be helpful later during merging.\n3. **Date Column's Data Type**: Currently, the date column is stored as a character type, which poses challenges for analysis. To address this, new columns will be created where the date will be converted into either date or date-time format using the `mdy()` and `mdy_hms()` functions. This standardized date-time formatting will ensure consistency across all datasets.\n\n***Daily DataFrames***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Naming conventions and date variable

It has been reported that a person can burn from [1,300 to 2,000+ calories a day](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/calories-burned-in-a-day/) without exercise. \n* The average **sedentary time** is **940.5 minutes** per day, equivalent to 16 hours, which is notably high. Studies have shown that [sedentary time exceeding 10 hours daily can lead to health problems](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7700832/). High sedentary time could be caused by \"[a lack of available spaces for exercise, increased occupational sedentary behaviours such as office work, and the increased penetration of television and video devices](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7700832/).\" However, other studies found that the American population's average daily sedentary time is reported to be [7.7 hours](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3527832/), significantly less than observed in this study.\n* Beside sedentary activity, people are mostly **lightly active** with an average of **216.5 minutes** (almost 4 hours) per day. \n* Average **fairly active** minutes per day is **15.21**. This, according to [World Health Organisation (WHO)](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity), does not reach the minimum required amount of 21-43 minutes per day. \n* Average **very active** minutes per day is **23.73**, which exceeds the [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity) minimum required amount of 11-21 minutes per day. \n* The average **total steps per day** is **8,518**, below the recommendeded 10,000 steps per day. \n* Participants **sleep** on average **419.3** minutes (around 7 hours) per day, meeting the minimum recommended duration for adults.\n* The average **METs** value is **1.034**, aligning with the high sedentary time as sedentary behaviour is characterised by energy expenditures [≤ 1.5 METs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6182813/).\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<a id=\"main-topics\"></a>\n## 4.2 Main Topics\nBased on the summary statistics, this analysis will focus on:\n1. **Physical Activity and Intensity levels** - How physically active (sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, very active) the users were and what intensity level they used (low, moderate, or high intensity).\n2. **Device Usage Patterns** - How often and when did the participants use the device.\n\n### 4.2.1 Physical Activity and Intensity Levels\nIt would be worth analysing how physically active the users were and what intensity they used throughout the duration of the study to discover any patterns that could help establish trends in smart device usage.\n\n#### **Percentage of Activity Levels**\nFrom the summary statistics above, it appears that there is a very high number of sedentary minutes in proportion to other activity levels.

How can these trends influence Bellabeat's marketing strategy?\n\n<a id=\"smart-device-usage-trends\"></a>\n## 5.1 Smart Device Usage Trends\n### Activity and Intensity Levels\n* The average **total steps per day** (**8,518**), fall below the recommended [10,000](https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1479-5868-8-79) steps per day.\n* **Very high sedentary time** (nearly 16 hours) can lead to multiple health issues. It was suggested that many users of the Fitbit device are professionals who do jobs which mostly involve sedentary behaviour.\n* The more active a person is, the more calories they burn. **The less active a person** is and **the longer they stay in a sedentary position, the fewer calories they burn**. \n* Only **3.25%** of participants were **fairly and very physically active** with **an average of 19.47 minutes per day**. This low figure suggests that not many users might be using the Fitbit device to track exercise; rather, they might be **tracking daily habits**. \n* During the weekday, **the highest intensity** is predominately from **17:00 to 19:00** when people usually go home from work. \n* During the weekend, **the peak in intensity and high activity** is on **Saturday afternoon** when people have more time to work out or do other activities that require higher intensities. However, on **Sunday, users are less active** as they tend to treat Sunday as **a rest day**. \n\n### Device Usage Levels\n* Most participants (**72.73%**) used the device **very frequently** for 21 - 31 days.\n* However, **54.78%** of the participants **did not wear the device** for the entire day. \n* **48.21%** of the participants **wore the device less than 20 hours per day**. \n* **The majority tracked their daily activity** but **did not monitor their sleep**.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<a id=\"applying-the-trends-to-bellabeat-customers\"></a>\n## 5.2 Applying the Trends to Bellabeat Customers\n### Activity and Intensity Levels\n1. **Working professionals**: Results suggest that Fitbit users are mostly working professionals as the highest intensity during the weekday is around 18:00, correlating to the time when people usually finish their work and go home. → Many Bellabeat customers are also working professionals.\n2. **Mental health problems and eating disorders**: There is a very high sedentary time, and the average number of total steps is less than the amount recommended by health experts. This corresponds to the information above suggesting that most users were **office workers** or **working professionals** who simply **did not find much time to workout** due to their busy schedule. It has been proposed that excessive **[sedentary time is associated with mental health issues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6082791/)** including depression, anxiety, and self-esteem. → Since the target market is female working professionals, this information is especially important as **women are [three times more](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/explore-mental-health/statistics/men-women-statistics) likely than men to experience common mental health problems and eating disorders**. \n\n### Device Usage Levels\n1. **Quality of Sleep**: Many Fitbit users voiced out that it is [uncomfortable to wear the tracker to bed](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sleep-Well/Who-else-doesn-t-wear-Fitbit-to-bed/td-p/1738710) and that they would rather save some battery or recharge the device during the bedtime. Some Fitbit users also mentioned that they [do not find the sleep data useful](https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sleep-Well/Who-else-doesn-t-wear-Fitbit-to-bed/td-p/1738710). These might be some of the reasons why not all users wore the tracker to bed and monitor their sleep. However, as per [Eatough](https://www.betterup.com/blog/sleep-trackers#:~:text=Sleep%20trackers%20can%20detect%20when,the%20time%20you%20are%20inactive): \"The amount and quality of sleep ... have a lasting impact on you when you’re awake. It affects your mental fitness, physical well-being, and even your risk of developing lifestyle diseases.\" → This is essential for the Bellabeat customers who might not be getting enough sleep which can not only impact their job performance but their wellness overall.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<a id=\"bellebeat-marketing-strategy-recs\"></a>\n## 5.3 Bellabeat Marketing Strategy Recommendations\nRecommendations were made based on the data analysis results that would benefit and target the female professionals. The recommendations are aimed to improve Bellabeat's Ivy health tracker.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### 5.3.1 Target Market\nThe target market for this marketing strategy is **female working professionals** who aim to support their mental health while staying fit. Their focus is not necessarily to optimise their fitness and workout performance, rather to **prioritise their mental and reproductive health by staying physically active and healthy amid their busy schedule.**\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### 5.3.2 Recommendations for Product Improvement\n#### **Personalised Workout Schedule for Female Working Professionals**\nMany Bellabeat customers are working professionals who might often be too busy to engage in regular exercise. [Studies](https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/exercise-only-weekends-rcna39325) propose that people with fewer opportunities for daily workouts during their work week can either workout for longer periods during the weekends and/or work for shorter periods during the week to maintain the recommended 75 - 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a week. Bellabeat can provide **personalised workout schedules that would not only reach the recommended amount of activity but also accommodate the user's busy schedule.**\n<br>\n<br>\n\n#### **Gentle Reminders and Inactivity Alerts**\nTo reduce the amount of sedentary time, Bellabeat added the inactivity alert feature which sends out alerts to the users when they have been inactive for too long, to remind them to get up and move around. This feature, however, is only available to Leaf and Time but not the Ivy tracker. Since Ivy focuses on wellness, vibrations and reminders might be too distracting which can induce anxiety. Instead, Ivy allows users to set their own daily goals for steps and activity to motivate them to make better choices for their health. However, knowing that the target market are female professionals who might be involved in daily prolonged sitting, **gentle inactivity alerts should still be an option as high sedentary behaviour has negative health effects.**\n<br>\n<br>\n\n### 5.3.3 Recommendations for Marketing Strategies\nBellabeat offers a personalised **holistic wellness approach to health** compared to companies such as Fitbit that are more fitness and performance-oriented. This gives Bellabeat a competitive edge as this holistic approach might be valued by female professionals who, according to [Priory (2023)](https://www.priorygroup.com/blog/why-are-stress-levels-among-women-50-higher-than-men), **are more likely to experience work-related stress**. \n\nBased on the analysis of this project, Bellabeat's marketing strategy should focus on the following aspects of the Ivy wellness tracking device:\n\n#### **Detailed Sleep Analysis**\nBellabeat Ivy provides a detailed sleep analysis with a score that is going to help guide users to make smarter, healthier decisions that would work with their body and mind. The marketing team should **stress the importance of sleep** as it is [vital to our health](https://www.betterup.com/blog/sleep-trackers#:~:text=Sleep%20trackers%20can%20detect%20when,the%20time%20you%20are%20inactive) and getting enough sleep keeps the body and mind in optimal condition and ready for the day. Since the working environment can be sometimes stressful and challenging, having a regular sleep routine and good night sleep is very important as it \"[restores the body, improves concentration, regulates mood, and sharpens judgement and decision-making](https://www.sleepscore.com/blog/how-rest-your-way-less-stress/#:~:text=How%20Can%20Sleep%20Reduce%20Stress,you're%20well%2Drested).\" Having **adequate sleep was proven to drastically reduce feelings of anxiety and improve the ability to process stress. Tracking sleep can help with maintaining a regular sleep schedule or diagnose and rectify sleep issues**. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n#### **Comfortable and Lightweight**\nDespite the importance of sleep tracking, some Fitbit users took off their tracking device during the night as they found it uncomfortable to sleep with. The marketing team should emphasise that **Bellabeat Ivy is incredibly lightweight making it very comfortable to wear anywhere and anytime including to bed**. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n#### **Strong Battery Life**\nBellabeat Ivy also boasts a long battery life that can last up to 8 days. Therefore, users would have to **worry less about recharging the device overnight**.\n<br>\n<br>\n\n<a id=\"selection-conclusion\"></a>\n# Conclusion\nThe purpose of this case study was to identify potential growth opportunities for Bellabeat, a wellness company, and improve their marketing strategy by analysing smart device usage among Fitbit consumers. Based on the analysis conducted, it can be concluded that the majority of fitness smart device users are working professionals who lack the recommended active minutes as they are often too busy to engage in regular exercise. Therefore, it is recommended to tailor Bellabeat's marketing strategies and products to working professionals by providing personalised workout schedules as well as implementing gentle inactivity alerts. Moreover, it was suggested to emphasise the importance of sleep because of its numerous benefits. These are the recommendations and conclusions drawn from the analysis of the Fitbit data. However, further analysis into other smart device companies such as the Apple Watch or Garmin is advised to support these results and provide additional insight into Bellabeat's strategies.","metadata":{}}]}
